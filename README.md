# Single-cell transcriptome and T-cell receptor analysis
  This is a personal record for my Single cell transcriptome and TCR analysis in the tumor immunotherapy  
  
  - utilizing transcriptome analysis to reveal the cellular heterogeneity, disease states, and developemntal lineage of tumor-filtrating lymphocyte in diverse cancer;
  - utilizing TCR analysis for clonal expansion of clonal dynamics of tumor-reactive T cells in immunotherapy
  
## Cell-level analysis
   - Unsupervised clustering
   - Compostional analysis
   - Trajectory analysis
   - Cell-to-cell communication

## Gene-level analysis 
   - Marker gene identification
   - Differential expressed gene analysis
   - Gene set enrichment analysis
   - Transcription factor regulatory network
